# React Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my React learning repository! This is a collection of small projects and code snippets that helped me understand and master React concepts.

## About This Repository

This repository contains various mini-projects and code examples that I built while learning React. Each project focuses on specific React concepts and best practices, making it easier to understand how React works through practical, hands-on experience.

## What's Inside

This collection includes projects covering:

- **React Fundamentals** - Components, JSX, props, and state
- **Hooks** - useState, useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks
- **Event Handling** - Managing user interactions
- **Forms & Validation** - Handling user input
- **API Integration** - Fetching and displaying data
- **Routing** - Navigation with React Router
- **State Management** - Context API and state lifting
- **Styling** - CSS modules, styled-components, or Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```

Navigate to any project folder and install dependencies:
```bash
cd project-name
npm install
```

Run the project:
```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `src/` - Source code files
- `public/` - Public assets
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `README.md` - Project-specific documentation (if applicable)

## Learning Resources

While building these projects, I found these resources helpful:
- [Official React Documentation](https://react.dev)
- [React Hooks Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react)
- FreeCodeCamp React tutorials
- YouTube tutorials and coding channels

## Purpose

These projects are designed to:
- Reinforce React concepts through practical application
- Serve as a reference for future projects
- Track my learning progress
- Help others who are learning React

## Contributing

This is a personal learning repository, but suggestions and improvements are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Goals

- [ ] Add more advanced projects (Redux, TypeScript)
- [ ] Implement testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Build full-stack applications with React
- [ ] Explore Next.js and React frameworks
